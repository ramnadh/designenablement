# Design Enablement
This is an old private repository in TFS online for enabling my teams on design patterns.
Moving the repository to github 

This repo mainly takes the Insurance Quote calcuation engine as usecase and drive through different design patterns and principles
  * Creational Patterns
  * Structural Patterns
  * Behavioural Patterns
  * Design Principles
  
It requires few updates and corrections to existing code and add new design principles and patterns based on the problem scenarios encountered.
